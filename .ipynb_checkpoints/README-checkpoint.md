# Exploring the Effectiveness of Betting Odds and Half Time Results for Predicting Football Match Outcomes

# BACKGROUND 
Data analysis has fully proliferated sports now. Not only is data extensively used by people who want to bet on the sport and make a buck out of it. Clubs have started hiring data analysts and scouts who leverage match player performance data, video footage, expected goals and assists, and data signals to understand and optimise their performance deeply. 

# VISUALISATION TECHNIQUES
There are a variety of visualisation techniques which can be used in this project and some of them include:
	•	Heat Maps : These can be useful to find the maximum/minimum possessed field area as well as can be used to find the correlation of different factors on match win %.
	•	Scatter Plots : We can create multiple scatter plots plotting various combinations of all the variables that we decide to include in our analysis. Scatter Plots can be used in tandem with k-means clustering which would allow us to interpret various common playing styles and groups of players or teams. 
	•	Box Plots : Visualising using box plot can be useful as this helps in identifying any outlier behaviour. Understanding and removing outliers will help us improve the accuracy of our model.
	•	Radar Map : This can clearly show us the strengths and weaknesses of each team.

# DATASET
As there are multiple factors which affect the win % of a team throughout the season. Therefore, we’ll be scraping data from multiple sources which provide information like possession, attendance, home/away team etc. We’ll be working on finding a couple more datasets which can be concatenated together. Then, used to build a regression model using some machine learning tools which would predict which team wins the match with some moderate to high accuracy. 
If the time allows we also plan to apply the regression model to leagues around the globe and therefore, predicting the winner of that season solely based on our model.

# WORK SPLIT
We both plan to split the work as such: The work will be split very evenly between the two. Sahaj will be focusing on the football aspect of the study, along with visualisation. Apram will be focusing on the data cleaning and scraping part of the project. Both of us plan to contribute equally to the regression/modelling part of the project where we try to predict football matches and infer which factor affects the result of football matches.
